## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called "pomodoros".

1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer for 25 minutes (one pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)
